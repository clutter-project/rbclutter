Ruby-Clutter -- Ruby bindings for Clutter-0.4.x
===============================================

This is a set of bindings for the Clutter 0.4 libraries for use from
Ruby.

Install
-------

 1. ruby extconf.rb
 2. make
 3. su
 4. make install

Dependencies
------------

To install the bindings the following is also needed:

 - Ruby >= 1.8
 - Clutter 0.4.x
 - Ruby GLib bindings

The optional clutter-gtk bindings depend on the Ruby GTK+ bindings and
clutter-cairo depends on the Ruby clutter bindings.

The clutter-gst bindings depend on the 0.10 version of the GStreamer
bindings available from here:

https://trac.luon.net/ruby-gstreamer0.10/

Issues
------

There's a few issues to be aware of with this release:

 - There's no documentation, however the method names try to follow
   the same system as the Ruby GTK bindings so you can generally read
   the Clutter API documentation and guess the Ruby method. See this
   page for details: http://tinyurl.com/3btpoq

 - There's no way to implement an interface or override a GObject
   method in Ruby code yet. So for example, you can create a Ruby
   object that is a subclass of Clutter::Actor, register it as a new
   GType and create custom signals, but you can not implement the
   ClutterLayout interface.

 - The effect functions can't take a callback block for when the
   effect is complete, even though the C API has a parameter for
   it. I'm hoping Clutter will eventually get a GDestroyNotify
   parameter for the effect functions which would make this a lot
   easier.

 - All of the ClutterTexture actors are tiled by default because the
   default value of the tiled property is calculated when the type
   class is created which in this case is before clutter_init is
   called.

 - Clutter::init isn't explictly called for you when you execute
   'require "clutter"'. That way you can optionally use your own
   argument array instead of ARGV. However, there appears to be a
   problem wrapping clutter-gst before gst_init is called, so if you
   execute 'require "clutter_gst"' it *will* explicitly call
   clutter_gst_init.
